We demand urgent action for a fast, comprehensive and just transition to clean renewable energy sources from dirty fossil fuels.
We demand an immediate end to fossil fuel subsidies and new fossil fuel projects, particularly for coal and the redirection of financial investments into clean energy.
The costs incurred by the transition in the short-term must be distributed in a socially equitable manner.
Those who can afford the most need to commit the most.
