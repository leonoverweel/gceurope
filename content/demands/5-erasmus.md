We demand that more investment and focus is put into providing Europe with sustainable transport networks.
Travel and the Erasmus+ scheme have played an important role in the lives of young Europeans and in creating a shared European identity.
It is important that neither mobility nor the environment are sacrificed.
The current infrastructure needs to be modernised in order to keep up with the demand for sustainable travel and to lower transport costs.
Night trains should be widely reintroduced and a tax on kerosene should be implemented.
