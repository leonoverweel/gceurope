It is time for EU leaders to face the fact that we are in a crisis.
Much more needs to be done and with greater urgency to tackle the climate crisis.
If we do not take drastic action within the next 10 years then it will be impossible to limit warming to 1.5Â° C, severely threatening our future.
We demand climate mainstreaming within the EU, meaning that all decisions need to be evaluated on their climate impact, taking into consideration other environmental issues.
