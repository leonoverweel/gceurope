This is no longer the time for shallow statements and unfulfilled promises.
We need concrete and drastic actions to tackle the current climate crisis.
If we do not take urgent action to reduce our emissions and our overall impact on the planet, then it will be impossible to limit warming to 2ºC, let alone 1.5ºC.
This will severely threaten our future and will be especially impactful on young people.
We demand that EU leaders face the fact that we are in a crisis and demonstrate their commitment with strong policies.
We demand climate mainstreaming, so that all decisions are evaluated on their environmental impact, considering any and all environmental issues.
