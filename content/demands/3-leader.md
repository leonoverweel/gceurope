The EU ratified the Paris Agreement.
However, the EU's efforts are insufficient to meet the most crucial climate goals.
The EU must now be an ambitious leader who pushes for further climate action.
It should enhance its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) before 2020 to align with a maximum 1.5Â°C increase.
The EU should also immediately adopt a long-term climate strategy for carbon neutrality, at the latest at the next European Council in October 2019.
