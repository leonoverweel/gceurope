We demand that more emphasis is placed on education as a means to empower the youth and to give them the tools needed to achieve a carbon-neutral and circular economy.
Further enhancement and emphasis needs to be made to informal education on sustainability.
More needs to be done to shift the mindset towards sustainable education for all, ensuring that both the physical learning environments and the curricula are sustainable and instil a sense of responsibility towards the environment.
