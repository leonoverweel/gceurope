Climate change and the environment are priorities for young Europeans.
After months of global strike action, young people have demonstrated their concern for climate change.
It is us, the youth, that will carry the burden of the current political inaction.
Young people want to have our opinions considered in the decision making process.
The EU has a responsibility to listen to its young people.
It is vital that we are consulted and that our voices are heard.
We demand to be included in the policy-making process, to be represented in the main meetings and that Commissioners regularly meet with representatives of the youth.
