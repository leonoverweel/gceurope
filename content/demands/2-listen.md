Todayâ€™s political inaction will determine our future.
The youth will face the full force of climate change and we must play a central role in the production of environmental policies.
The European Green Deal must be built in cooperation with the Youth.
It is vital that we are consulted and that our voices are heard.
We demand to be included in the policy-making process, to be represented in the main meetings and that Commissioners regularly meet with representatives of the coalition.
We demand transparency on how our inputs are being integrated into policy.
